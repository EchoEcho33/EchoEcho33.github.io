# PortfolioSite

In this page I made a short portfolio with some of my artwork in it. I plan on adding to this page and making a popup window to show the full artwork when the card is clicked on. I have some experience making apps with React and the shopify polaris library, so I decided to try and make something with normal javascript/html/css. I added a few hover properties in the page:
Â 
1. Over the art card

2. On the social media buttons

This indicates they're interactable (the art card will be when I figure that out). The social media buttons light up when you hover on them, and open the link to my art social media pages in a new window using target="_blank". The links also have the noopener noreferrer property to ensure security.
